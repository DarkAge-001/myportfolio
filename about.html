            <p class="about-description">
                I am an electrical engineer with a specialization in instrumentation and control, passionate about creating innovative solutions in automation, smart technologies, and renewable energy. 
                My technical expertise spans Python programming, Flask, HTML, CSS, and simulaton tools like proteus, which I leverage to design and implement user-focused systems.
                I earned recognition as the first-place winner at ICEPT 2024 for presenting an automated electric fish dryer with solar input backup, a project combining engineering principles with sustainable innovation.
                My work reflects my commitment to solving real-world problems through creative and efficient solutions.
                As I continue to explore advanced Python frameworks, AI-driven technologies, and IoT systems, my goal is to contribute to transformative projects in energy, automation, and smart systems. 
                Whether collaborating with teams or leading initiatives, I am driven to deliver impactful results that bridge technology and practical applications.
