                    <h3>Obstacle Avoidance Robotic Car</h3>
                    <p>An Obstacle avoidance robotic car is an autonomous vehicle designed to detect and avoid obstacles in its path using sensors like Ultrasonic.
                        it employs algorithms to process sensor data and adjust its movement, ensuring smooth navigation without collisions.
                        I carried out this project with my team during my 500Level second semester while in University. You can contact me for the schematic diagram and code.

                    <h3>Automated Electric fish dryer with Solar input as backup</h3>
                    <p>An Automated electric fish dryer is a system designed to efficiently dry fish using electric heating elements, with a solar input as a backup energy source. 
                        it incorporates automation features such as temperature and timer controls to optimize drying conditions, ensuringconsistent results. This project offers a sustainable and reliable solution
                        for fish preservation, especially in areas with limited electricity.<br> Using my school environ as a case study this project was to help and uplift the local fishermen and women in the rural communities
                        to preserve their fish produce and enable them protect the eco-system from carbon pollution.<br> This Project was carried out by myself and my team which include: Divine Teryanger Akyigh and Ojo Andrew Oghenefejiro.
                        <br> This project won two awards as best innovative project during ICEPT2024 and STEW2024 by the NIEEE body.
