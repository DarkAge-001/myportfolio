                    <h3>Obstacle Avoidance Robotic Car</h3>
                    <p>An Obstacle avoidance robotic car is an autonomous vehicle designed to detect and avoid obstacles in its path using sensors like Ultrasonic.
                        it employs algorithms to process sensor data and adjust its movement, ensuring smooth navigation without collisions.
                        I carried out this project with my team during my 500Level second semester while in University. You can contact me for the schematic diagram and code.

                    <h3>Automated Electric fish dryer with Solar input as backup</h3>
                    <p>An Automated electric fish dryer is a system designed to efficiently dry fish using electric heating elements, with a solar input as a backup energy source. 
                        it incorporates automation features such as temperature and timer controls to optimize drying conditions, ensuringconsistent results. This project offers a sustainable and reliable solution
                        for fish preservation, especially in areas with limited electricity.<br> Using my school environ as a case study this project was to help and uplift the local fishermen and women in the rural communities
                        to preserve their fish produce and enable them protect the eco-system from carbon pollution.<br> This Project was carried out by myself and my team which include: Divine Teryanger Akyigh and Ojo Andrew Oghenefejiro.
                        <br> This project won two awards as best innovative project during ICEPT2024 and STEW2024 by the NIEEE body.

                    <h3>IoT-based smart waste management system</h3>
                    <p>An IoT-based smart waste management system uses sensor, microcontrollers to monitor bin levels, optimize waste collection, and reduce overflow.
                        It can send real-time alerts to munipal authorities via cloud platforms. This improves efficiency, reduce costs and promotes environmental sustainability.</p>

                <h3>IoT-based Smart Home Automation</h3>
                <p>
                    Home automation using the Internet of things (IoT) enables remote monitoring and control of household devices via the internet. IoT-based home automation systems
                    use sensors, actuators, microcontrollers and wireless communication protocols to automate tasks suh as lighting, temperature control, security, and energy management. <br>
